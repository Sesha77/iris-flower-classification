        "The project \"Iris Flower Classification Using Machine Learning\" focuses on building an efficient predictive model to classify Iris flowers into one of three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, or Iris-virginica, using supervised learning techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, contains 150 samples with four numerical features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The project begins with data preprocessing, including duplicate/missing value checks and outlier handling, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations like pair plots, heatmaps, and box plots.\n",
        "\n",
        "Several machine learning models were implemented, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree Classifier. Among these, the Decision Tree model, optimized using GridSearchCV, outperformed others with 100% accuracy on the test data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature importance analysis confirmed that petal length and width are the most influential features in determining the flower species. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to validate model performance, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.\n",
        "\n",
        "The final model is interpretable, fast, and highly accurate, making it suitable for educational use, botanical research, and mobile apps for real-time flower identification. This project demonstrates how machine learning can turn structured data into intelligent, real-world predictions.\n",
